/**
 *  The rack processor keeps an internal collection of AudioProcessor objects and plays them either in
 *  series or as single processors.
 *
 *  This processor is a lock-free implementation, by that means, in each processCallback it will check
 *  any pending update messages from the message thread and handle them one at a time.
 *
 *  Processors are stored and differentiated by IDs, these IDs are represented as a case-insensitive (they will be
 *  stored lowercase anyway) and whitespaceless string.
 *  Each ID must be unique and can't be assigned twice.
 *
 *  The initialisation function that is passed through the constructor of this processor, handles the mapping of
 *  IDs to processors.
 *  Whenever there needs to be a new processor added, it will call this function and return the processor which is
 *  assigned the id.
 *  Note that processor must be dynamically allocated.
 *
 *  Important for IDs is that they can't contain any whitespaces in the middle of the string, whitespaces at the
 *  end and beginning will be trimmed.
 *  In addition, all IDs will be converted to lower-case, so don't expect mapping different IDs only through
 *  changing its case representation or adding whitespaces.
 *
 *  Such a function may look like:
 *  @code
 *  std::shared_ptr<SerializableAudioProcessor> createProcessorFromId(const juce::String &id)
 *  {
 *      if(id == "processor1")
 *      {
 *          return std::make_shared<AudioProcessor1>();
 *      }
 *      else if(id == "processor2")
 *      {
 *          return std::make_shared<AudioProcessor2>();
 *      }
 *
 *      return nullptr;
 *  }
 *  @endcode
