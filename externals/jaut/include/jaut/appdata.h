/**
    Wraps information about a certain directory.

    This class is part of the AppData class to create a managed app structure with which you can organise your app's
    file system usage a lot better and easier.
    That also means that you can't use this class without a valid AppData instance.
    You can only construct invalid Directory objects yourself.
    However, if you need a valid one you need an AppData object.

    This class also keeps track of its parent directories as long as they exist.
