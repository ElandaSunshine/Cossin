 * This file is just a substitute header for the yaml-cpp library.
 * This prevents the compiler for throwing an include error when
 * no yaml-cpp library was linked.
 * 
 * If you need to use the yaml-cpp library, check it out here:
 * https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp
 * 
 * Import the sources into your project and make sure to include
 * its headers before jaut's headers.
